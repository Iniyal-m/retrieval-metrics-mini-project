# Retrieval Metrics Mini Project

Build a tiny evaluation tool that measures how good a search system is.

In this mini project you will implement `eval.js` so it scores two search systems, keyword search and semantic search, on the same set of test queries, computes **MRR** and **Recall@10** for each, and prints a **markdown comparison table**. No database or API keys are needed: the two systems' ranked results are already captured for you as data, so you can focus on the metrics themselves.

## What is in this project

- `eval.js` : the file you build. It has four TODOs; the file-loading is done for you.
- `test-set.csv` : 10 `(query, correct_post_ids)` pairs. A row may list more than one correct answer, semicolon-separated (for example `1024;1025`).
- `search-results.json` : for each query, the top-10 ranked `post_id` list each system returned, shaped as `{ "<query>": { "keyword": [...], "semantic": [...] } }`. Array position 0 is rank 1.
- `posts-dataset.csv` : the 35 posts the ids refer to (for sanity-checking; not required by the core build).

## What to build

1. **Load** `test-set.csv` and `search-results.json` (already wired up in the starter).
2. **Reciprocal Rank:** for one query, return `1 / rank` of the first correct id in a ranked list, or `0` if no correct id is in the top 10 (rank is 1-based).
3. **Evaluation loop:** for every query, compute the reciprocal rank for the keyword and semantic lists and count a hit whenever the correct answer is in the top 10. Then compute, for each system:
   - **MRR** = average reciprocal rank across all 10 queries.
   - **Recall@10** = (queries whose correct answer is in the top 10) / 10.
4. **Print a markdown comparison table:** one row per query with keyword and semantic ranks (`miss` when not found), then a **Summary** row with each system's MRR and Recall@10 rounded to two decimals.

## Formulas

```text
Reciprocal Rank (one query) = 1 / (rank of the first correct answer)
                            = 0   if the correct answer is not in the top 10
MRR       = average of the reciprocal ranks over all queries
Recall@10 = (queries whose correct answer is in the top 10) / (total queries)
```

## Run it

```bash
node eval.js
```

## Expected output

A correct `eval.js` prints exactly this table. If your numbers differ, your metric code has a bug.

```text
| Query | Keyword rank | Semantic rank |
|---|---|---|
| my redis cache keeps showing old data | 8 | 1 |
| how do I add semantic search to a table I already have | miss | 2 |
| redis or memcached for caching | 1 | 2 |
| why did my query get slower after I added an index | miss | 1 |
| what does ACID actually guarantee | 2 | 1 |
| how do I keep my postgres online while changing the schema | 6 | 3 |
| my background jobs stop after every deploy | miss | 2 |
| how do I let my database accept more writes per second | 4 | 1 |
| sql or nosql for a new product | 1 | 3 |
| why does my redis memory keep climbing | miss | 2 |
| **Summary** | **MRR 0.30 · Recall@10 0.60** | **MRR 0.67 · Recall@10 1.00** |
```

## Write up your findings

Add a short interpretation (4 to 6 sentences) to this README or a `RESULT.md`:
- Which system is better overall, and on which metric(s)?
- Which queries did keyword search win, and what do those queries have in common?
- Which queries did semantic search win, and what do those have in common?
- One sentence on why a team would still keep the weaker system around (hint: the two systems win on different queries).

## Take it further (optional)

If you have a working Postgres with the posts loaded and embeddings generated, swap `search-results.json` for real searches:

```sql
-- Keyword search (PG full-text)
SELECT post_id
FROM posts
WHERE to_tsvector('english', title || ' ' || body) @@ plainto_tsquery('english', $1)
ORDER BY ts_rank(to_tsvector('english', title || ' ' || body), plainto_tsquery('english', $1)) DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Semantic search (pgvector)
SELECT post_id FROM posts ORDER BY embedding <=> $1 LIMIT 10;
```

Wire each into `async keywordSearch(query)` and `async semanticSearch(query)` returning ranked `post_id` lists, then run your exact same metric code. The metrics do not change, only where the ranked lists come from.
